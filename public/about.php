      <h1>So... who's behind this thing?</h1>
      <p>Hi! I’m <a href="https://hannahap.com" title="Hannah A. Patellis’ website">Hannah A. Patellis</a> and I just moved to MPLS from Atlanta, Georgia! A technology nerd through-and-through, I love retro tech as a hobby and from 9-to-5 I work in IT.</p>
      <p>Back in the Atlanta area there was a retro tech club (<a href="https://www.atlhcs.org" title="Atlanta Historical Computing Society homepage">shout-out to Atlanta Historical Computing Society</a>) that I deeply enjoyed. When I got here to the Cities, I was sad there wasn’t anything quite like it. So I decided to start gauging interest in starting one!</p>
      <p>This website, the <a href="/proposal.php" title="Club proposal page">club proposal</a>, and pretty much everything else here are subject to change. I'm very much still in the "planning" and "gauging interest" phase!</p>
      <p>Interested in helping? Joining? Questions, comments, and/or concerns? <a href="mailto:hello@mnretrotech.org">Shoot me an email!</a>
